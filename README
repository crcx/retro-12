Retro is a concatenative, stack-based programming language with
roots in Forth. It is intended to be clean and practical.

IMPORTANT:

This is the start of what will eventually become Retro 12. The
current stable release is Retro 11. Things here are subject to
change drastically at this point and should not be used for any
serious applications at this time.
