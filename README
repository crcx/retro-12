Retro is a concatenative, stack-based programming language with
roots in Forth. It is intended to be clean and practical.

All code, documentation, and any binaries included are provided
under the ISC License unless otherwise noted in the source. Please
feel free to take, use, and modify Retro as you see fit.

IMPORTANT:

This is the start of what will eventually become Retro 12. The
current stable release is Retro 11. Things here are subject to
change drastically at this point and should not be used for any
serious applications at this time.


NOTES:

- This is *not* compatible with 11.x code yet
- Many functions are being renamed / removed / revised
- A compatibility library will be provided to smooth over most of this

In implementing this, I am backporting functionality from Parable,
adding new bits, and generally trying to make a smaller kernel with a
richer standard library. It'll ultimately be a leaner core language,
with lots of modules to expand it into a more capable system (allowing
better usability on embedded targets).

To facilitate code sharing between Parable and Retro, some functions
and naming conventions will be modified. (e.g., use of dashes in multi
word names, and consistent behavior between combinators that both share).
