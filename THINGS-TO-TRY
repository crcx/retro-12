After building with 'make', try these:


For a base Retro system:

  ./retro


For a more full featured Retro:

  ./retro --with stdlib.rx


For the above, with vector functions:

  ./retro --with vectors.rx --with stdlib.rx


For the above, with remapable input (remapKeys, ws, and backspace support):

  ./retro --with remapable-input.rx --with vectors.rx --with stdlib.rx
