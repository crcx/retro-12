- move more stuff from retro-12.na to higher level code

- split stdlib.rx into multiple modules, organized by category

  - remapable input
  - prefixes
  - additional combinators

- add comments to sources

- define d->additional layout

  at a minimum, add docstrings and :doc

- rewrite : in terms of: [ ] define

  probably something like this:

  [ getToken ` [ ] ':' define
  [ ` ] swap define ] ';' define immediate
 
- write compatibility layer for retro-11
  (for this, I'm tempted to rewrite the old kernel in retro-12, and then load
   the stage2.rx over that; effectively packing the entire old image into a
   vocabulary)
